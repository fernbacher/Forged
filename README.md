Forged is an AME Wizard playbook for Windows 11 designed for gaming performance, low latency, and user privacy.

It achieves this by aggressively removing a wide range of Windows components and applying deep system modifications.

Key changes include:

    Complete Security Removal: Windows Defender, SmartScreen, and the Security Center are entirely removed. Kernel-level security mitigations (Spectre/Meltdown) are disabled.

    Aggressive Component Stripping: Microsoft Edge, OneDrive, Cortana, Microsoft Store, Windows Backup, and most default UWP applications are eliminated.

    Service & Feature Disabling: Disables non-essential background services.

    Performance & Latency Tuning: Applies kernel, boot, and network tweaks designed to minimize system overhead and input latency.

    Privacy Enforcement.

This playbook is intended for dedicated gaming machines and expert users. It heavily compromises system security for performance gains.
